# WEATHER APP

This project is a weather forecast site using the OpenWeatherAPI. The user can search for a specific location and the app will display local weather details. The application does this by consuming the API and showing the desired data to the user. Full Project Description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app)
